# Flixster
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
Completed steps toward this application:

- User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.


- Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

### Notes
I faced some challenges working in the UI.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
